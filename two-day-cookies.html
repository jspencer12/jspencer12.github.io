<h4>PREPARATION</h4>
1. <b>Make the toffee:</b> Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.<br>
2. In a medium nonstick saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter, brown sugar, and salt, stirring until evenly incorporated. If there are grainy lumps or if the fat starts to separate, add a couple splashes of water and stir vigorously to emulsify. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture reaches 290°F (143°C), about 10-15 minutes. *If it burns slightly it's not the end of the world because you now have "burnt toffee" cookies.<br>
3. Pour the toffee onto the prepared baking sheet and spread out slightly with a spatula. Freeze until ready to use, about 30 minutes.<br> <br>
4. <b>Make the cookie dough</b>: Add the butter to a pretty big nonstick saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the butter turns dark brown and smells nutty. Watch carefully so the butter does not burn. Remove the pot from the heat.<br>
5. Add an ice cube to the butter and slowly let it melt. It may froth and bubble. Add the remaining 3 ice cubes and gently stir until melted.<br>
6. In a large bowl, combine the granulated and brown sugar, salt, and baking soda.<br>
7. Pour the brown butter into the sugar mixture and mix until combined. Don’t worry if it looks separated.<br>
8. In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs and vanilla. Pour into the sugar and butter mixture and whisk until glossy and smooth.<br>
9. Add the flour and fold with a rubber spatula to incorporate until the dough has no visible flour streaks.<br>
10. Remove the toffee from the freezer (it should be a frozen disc) and break it into chunks that will fit inside a gallon zip-top bag. Double bag the toffee and seal both bags. With a rolling pin, break the toffee into small pieces.<br>
11. Fold the crushed toffee and chopped chocolate into the dough until evenly distributed.<br>
12. Using a large ice cream scoop or a ½ cup measure, scoop the dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet.  Wrap the baking sheet in plastic wrap, but leave a small opening at the corner of the tray.<br>
13. Let the dough rest in the refrigerator for at least 48 hours. This will allow the flavor to develop and the dough to dry out a little as it rests, which will result in less spread when it bakes. *They still taste good if you cook them immediately, but the 2 days is a good way to pace yourself. I find myself eating them over the course of a week.<br>
14. When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 325°F (163°C). Line 2 baking sheet with parchment paper. <br>
15. Arrange the cookies on the baking sheets, leaving at least 2 inches of space between the cookies and away from the edges of the pan.<br>
16. Bake until the cookies are golden brown with crispy edges, but are still slightly soft in the center. *Original recipe says 18-20, but I do 22-24 minutes.<br>
Immediately sprinkle the cookies with flaky sea salt. then let cool completely. The cookies will be very soft at first but will set after they are fully cooled.<br>
17. Enjoy! (With milk!)
