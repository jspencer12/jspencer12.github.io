<center><h2>Kenya Trip - August 2023</h2>
If you're here, you're probably from Y Combinator interested in seeing a few pics from my improvised tour of the Kenyan running village of Kaptagat. Enjoy!

This is the hostel I found where the other runners train. Truly beautiful location, but since the structure was quite old it was only $10/night. Between workout sessions the runners love to just sit and talk and asked me a million questions about America, including politics, Bitcoin, population trends.

Running with them was so fun! They didn't even break a sweat with me :) From left to right: Mark Kiptoo, Benson Kiplimo, Kipkemei Mutai, Micah Kogo. These guys are faster than every American distance runner, but in Africa they are middle-of-the-pack pros.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliud_Kipchoge">Eliud Kipchoge</a> has held the marathon world record for the last decade and was the first human to run faster than 2hrs. He was a bit shy, but very kind and wrote me a sweet note. He has been an inspiration for a long time and meeting him was the goal of my trip.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin_Kiptum>Kelvin Kiptim</a> broke Kipchoge's WR on 10/8/2023, becoming the first person to run sub 2:01 in a record eligible race. People clued into running knew he was capable of something special, and when I heard he also trained in the area, I went to great lengths to meet him as well. He had a very fun, energetic personality.
