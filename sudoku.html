<center><h2>The Jonathan and Friends New York Times Sudoku Log</h2>
I really enjoy sudoku! I just got into it early 2023 and have since dedicated a delightfully unhealthy amount of time to it.
<p>
I play the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/sudoku">New York Times Sudoku</a> every day and track my own scores anyway, I thought it would be fun to make a way for my friends to track their scores, since the NYTimes app doesn't have that function. This is a work in progress, but if you want to participate, just log your scores in the form below and watch them pop up in the table. The table should republish every few minutes, so just wait a sec and then refresh. Your personal stats should update immediately!
<p>
If you're just getting started with Sudoku and want to learn some higher level strategy, I really recommend the Cracking the Cryptic YouTube channel, especially some of their <a href="https://youtu.be/-24S4mHY73w">older</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/QgkVz9sdHEs">videos</a>. When I find a daily puzzle that totally stumps me, I'll often look for a youtube video that does a walk-through to see if I can learn a new trick. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b11RIwmC5W0&list=PL7B_esJLNuKPxfC2osxUsQAPDrKMNewDd&pp=iAQB">Rangsk</a> is pretty good.
<p>
Happy solving!
